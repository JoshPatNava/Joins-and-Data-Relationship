# Joins-and-Data-Relationship

## Overview
In this notebook I will be practicing skils with joining differing dataframes and then learning about the relationships

## Tools
- Python(Jupyter)
- Using pd.merge
- value_counts(), isna()

## Key Takeaways
- Left joings perserve original data from left table, and will expose missing data
- Inner joins creates a risk of losing data
- Duplicate keys creates too many rows which are many to many
- Use validate= as a powerful check
